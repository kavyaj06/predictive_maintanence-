Vehicle Engine Sample Data - BAD Condition
==========================================

This file contains sample data points that represent engines in BAD condition.
Use these values to test the OBD prediction model.

Sample 1 - Bad Engine (Low RPM, High Temps)
-------------------------------------------
Engine rpm: 500
Lub oil pressure: 1.5
Fuel pressure: 20.0
Coolant pressure: 0.5
lub oil temp: 95.0
Coolant temp: 110.0

Sample 2 - Overheating Engine
-----------------------------
Engine rpm: 800
Lub oil pressure: 2.0
Fuel pressure: 25.0
Coolant pressure: 0.8
lub oil temp: 105.0
Coolant temp: 120.0

Sample 3 - Low Oil Pressure
---------------------------
Engine rpm: 1200
Lub oil pressure: 1.0
Fuel pressure: 30.0
Coolant pressure: 0.6
lub oil temp: 100.0
Coolant temp: 115.0

Sample 4 - Fuel System Issues
-----------------------------
Engine rpm: 600
Lub oil pressure: 1.8
Fuel pressure: 15.0
Coolant pressure: 0.4
lub oil temp: 98.0
Coolant temp: 108.0

Sample 5 - Multiple System Failure
----------------------------------
Engine rpm: 400
Lub oil pressure: 0.8
Fuel pressure: 12.0
Coolant pressure: 0.3
lub oil temp: 110.0
Coolant temp: 125.0

Sample 6 - Cooling System Failure
---------------------------------
Engine rpm: 900
Lub oil pressure: 2.2
Fuel pressure: 28.0
Coolant pressure: 0.2
lub oil temp: 102.0
Coolant temp: 130.0

Warning Signs in Bad Engines:
- Low RPM (below 1000 often indicates problems)
- Low oil pressure (below 2.0 is concerning)
- Low fuel pressure (below 30.0 may indicate fuel pump issues)
- Low coolant pressure (below 1.0 indicates leaks or pump failure)
- High oil temperature (above 100°C indicates overheating)
- High coolant temperature (above 105°C indicates cooling problems)
